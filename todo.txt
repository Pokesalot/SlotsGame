Rewrite top-level functions that symbols can use. Each return booleans to limit symbol logic
- Get Random(Symbol): 
    Does a seed grow, or a chicken lay an egg
- Get Spin Threshold(Symbol): 
    All symbols count up when spun, and check if enough spins have elapsed for something to happen. 
    Impacted by some items and synergies
- Get Pertinence(Symbol1, Symbol2, Pos1, Pos2): 
    Will these symbols interact? 
    Only runs if the symbols have applicable tags and is mainly used to check adjacency. 
    In some cases, a symbol's adjacency does not matter, or symbols are counted as "adjacent" to all other symbols.

Lexer Parser for symbol and item effects:
    Symbols and Items will be saved in a json with effects listed as query strings.
    e.g. "Gives qWildcard To adj #Suits"
    e.g. "Gets +1 From adj #humanoids Limit 1"
    Depending on effect given, can be applied to a Gamestate.Permanents stack, or simply apply temporarily.
    THIS WILL TAKE A LOT OF WORK BUT WHEN IT WORKS WILL MAKE ADDING OR MODIFYING BEHAVIOR WAY EASIER!!!!
    Qualities to check for:
        <number> will refer to a space
        me will refer to the space the symbol is in, and can be permuted e.g. me+4 or me-4 in the case of a crab
        q<quality> will refer to both temporary and permanent qualities/tags, which may include "deleting" or wildcard given to suits next to a cardshark
        #<quality> will refer to only permanent qualities in the json file
        '<name> will refer to a symbol by name

        Any of these can be preceded by a ! to signify that the symbol not match the following quality
        Where one or more qualities are matched, the list will be interpreted as an AND list, all qualities must be true for the effect to be given/received

- Not from where, that shounds like shit, but a list of adds, multis, and a total at bottom
